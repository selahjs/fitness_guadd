# Ethiopian Telegram Communities Bot

Fitness Guadd -- A Telegram bot that helps users discover and join Ethiopian communities (groups and channels) based on interests, categories, language, location, and other relevant filters.

## üåü Project Vision

This bot aims to solve the problem of finding relevant Ethiopian Telegram communities that match specific interests like tech, fitness, education, and more. The default Telegram search functionality is limited, so this bot provides enhanced discovery mechanisms with Ethiopia-specific focus.

- Location-based filtering (cities and regions in Ethiopia)
- Community submission system for users to add new groups/channels
- Hybrid search combining stored database and real-time Telegram search
- Support for both English and Amharic languages

### Phase 3: Advanced Features üìù [PLANNED]
